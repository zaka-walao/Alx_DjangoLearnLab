**Objective:** Demonstrate proficiency in Django by creating a Book model within a Django app, implementing it according to specified attributes, and using Django’s ORM to perform database operations.

## Task Description:
For this task, you will develop a Django app named bookshelf within your existing Django project. You will define a Book model with specific attributes and demonstrate basic CRUD operations through the Django shell. This task is structured to ensure consistent implementations suitable for automated checking.

### Steps:
1. Create the bookshelf App:

   - In your Django project directory, use Django’s command-line utility to generate a new app: python manage.py startapp bookshelf.

2. Define the Book Model:

   - Navigate to bookshelf/models.py.
   - Create a Book class with the following fields:
      * title: CharField with a maximum length of 200 characters.
      * author: CharField with a maximum length of 100 characters.
      * publication_year: IntegerField.

Ensure the model is correctly set up for migrations.
## my personal notes 
```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Other installed apps
    'bookshelf',
]
```

Ensure that bookshelf is listed in the INSTALLED_APPS setting in your settings.py file. Open settings.py and find the INSTALLED_APPS list. Add 'bookshelf' to the list if it's not already there:
1. Model Migration:

   - Prepare your model for database integration by running python manage.py makemigrations bookshelf to create migration files.
   - Apply migrations to update the database with python manage.py migrate.

2. Interact with the Model via Django Shell:

   - Open the Django shell with python manage.py shell and execute CRUD operations:
     * Create a Book instance.
     * Retrieve the book you created.
     * Update the title of the created book.
     * Delete the book instance.

solution:
```python
from bookshelf.models import Book
new_book = Book(title='New Book', author='Jane Smith', publication_year=2024)

```

*Perform Specific CRUD Operations in the Django Shell:* - Document each operation in separate Markdown files (create.md, retrieve.md, update.md, delete.md) detailing both the Python command used and its output.

### Detailed CRUD Operations and Documentation:
**Create:**

- Command: Create a `Book` instance with the title “1984”, author “George Orwell”, and publication year 1949.
 - Document in: `create.md`
- Expected Documentation: Include the Python command and a comment with the expected output noting the successful creation.


**Retrieve:**

- Command: Retrieve and display all attributes of the book you just created.
- Document in: `retrieve.md`
- Expected Documentation: Include the Python command and a comment with the expected output showing the details of the book.


**Update:**

- `Command:` Update the title of “1984” to “Nineteen Eighty-Four” and save the changes.
- Document in: `update.md`
- Expected Documentation: Include the Python command and a comment with the expected output showing the updated title.


**Delete:**

- Command: Delete the book you created and confirm the deletion by trying to retrieve all books again.
- Document in: `delete.md`
- Expected Documentation: Include the Python command and a comment with the expected output confirming the deletion.


### Implementation and Submission Instructions:
- **Code Implementation:** Your `models.py` file should correctly define the `Book` model as specified. Ensure that all field types and options are accurately implemented.


- **Database Operations:** Perform and document each CRUD operation in the Django shell. Save your commands and their outputs in a file named `CRUD_operations.md.`
