## Implement Role-Based Access Control in Django

**Objective:** Implement role-based access control within a Django application to manage different user roles and permissions effectively. You will extend the User model and create views that restrict access based on user roles.

## Task Description:
In your Django project, you will extend the Django `User` model to include user roles and develop views that restrict access based on these roles. Your task is to set up this system by creating a new model for user profiles, defining views with access restrictions, and configuring URL patterns.

## Step 1: Extend the User Model with a UserProfile
Create a `UserProfile` model that includes a `role` field with predefined roles. This model should be linked to Django’s built-in `User` model with a one-to-one relationship.

- Fields Required:
  - `user:` OneToOneField linked to Django’s User.
  - `role:` CharField with choices for ‘Admin’, ‘Librarian’, and ‘Member’.

- Automatic Creation: Use Django signals to automatically create a `UserProfile` when a new user is registered.

## Step 2: Set Up Role-Based Views
Create three separate views to manage content access based on user roles:

- **Views to Implement:**

  - An `Admin view that only users with the ‘Admin’ role can access, the name of the file should be `admin_view`
  - A ‘Librarian’ view accessible only to users identified as ‘Librarians’. The file should be named `librarian_view`
  - A ‘Member’ view for users with the ‘Member’ role, the name of the file should be `member_view`

- **Access Control:**

  - Utilize the `@user_passes_test` decorator to check the user’s role before granting access to each view.


## Step 3: Configure URL Patterns
Define URL patterns that will route to the newly created role-specific views. Ensure that each URL is correctly linked to its respective view and that the URLs are named for easy reference.

- **URLs to Define:**
  - A URL for the ‘Admin’ view.
  - A URL for the ‘Librarian’ view.
  - A URL for the ‘Member’ view.
