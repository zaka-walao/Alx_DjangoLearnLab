## Deep Dive into Django Models and Views

In this project, “Deep Dive into Django Models and Views,” you will advance your skills in using Django, a `high-level Python web framework`. 

This project is designed for novice learners aiming to solidify their understanding of `Django’s ORM capabilities`, `view configurations`, and `user authentication features`. 

Through a series of hands-on tasks, you will implement complex model relationships, develop both function-based and class-based views, and manage user authentication and permissions. 

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build robust and scalable web applications using Django.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. **Implement Advanced Model Relationships in Django:**

   - Master Django’s ORM capabilities by creating models that demonstrate ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne relationships.
   - Effectively model complex data relationships in a Django project.

2. **Develop Django Views and URL Configuration:**

   - Gain proficiency in creating function-based and class-based views in Django.
   - Configure URL patterns to handle web requests effectively, routing them to the appropriate views.
3. **Manage User Authentication in Django:**

   - Set up user login, logout, and registration functionalities using Django’s built-in authentication system.
   - Develop views and templates to demonstrate user session and permission management.
4. **Implement Role-Based Access Control in Django:**

   - Extend the Django User model to include user roles and create views that restrict access based on these roles.
   - Utilize Django signals to automatically create a UserProfile when a new user is registered.

5. **Implement Custom Permissions in Django:**

   - Add custom permissions to the Book model to control actions such as adding, editing, and deleting entries based on user roles.
